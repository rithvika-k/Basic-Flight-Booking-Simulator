# Basic-Flight-Booking-Simulator

Flight Booking System Simulator
- allows the user to book a ticket to any of the travel destinations we offer, they are able to input personal information 
  and book a ticket. This will then be outputted to the user in the form of a booking receipt

NOTES
- implemented arrays and sorting arrays
- implemented try and catch blocks 
- implemented classes:
1. a Ticket class which acts as a storage to hold key attributes of any ticket object created although the Ticket class isnt used as much, its mainly to keep the code organized and make working with the attributes of any ticket object easier in the future (Future assignments as i build on this program)
